This will describe the process for importing data into the WQReview Graphical User Interface (GUI). We will start by importing data for a 
single site using predefined NWIS parameter groups. At the end we will see how to import data for multiple sites
and custom parameter lists.

## Load the WQReview package and open the WQReview GUI

1. Load the WQReview package by typing the following into your R script or command window:

```R
library(WQReview)
```

1. To open the GUI run the WQReviewGUI() function.

```R
WQReviewGUI()
```

The GUI window will open in your system's default internet browser. **It is recommended that hte GUI be run in Google Chrome.** If the GUI opens in internet explorer, you need to change your system's default browser to Google Chrome by opening Google Chrome and going to settings -> default browser (bottom of page).

## Importing data

The data import tab has 10 main inputs:

1. Site number: This input takes a manually entered site number(s). Type the site number in and click "add". You may add as many site numbers as you would like. Remove a site number by clicking it and hitting the backspace or delete keys. Alternatively, click in the box and press the backspace key to incrementally remove the numbers starting with the last entry.
    
1. Site number file: This input takes a file of site IDs. The file must be a single column text file of site numbers.Make sure leading zero's have not been removed if using excel to generate the file.

1. Parameter codes: This input takes a manually entered parameter codes (pcodes). This behaves the same as the site number input.

1. pCode file: This input takes a file of pcodes. The file must be a single column text file of pcodes. Make sure leading zero's have not been removed if using excel to generate the file.

1. Start date: The start date for the data pull. Samples collected after this date will be retrieved. The default value is 10 years before the current date.

1. End date: The end date for the data pull. Samples collected before this date will be retrieved. The default is the current date.

1. Server name (DSN): The name of your nwis server data source name (DSN) that was established during ODBC setup.

1. Environmental DB number: The number cooresponding to the environmental database. Default is "01"

1. QA DB Number: The number cooresponding to the QA sample database. Default is "02"

#A basic data import
We will start with a basic data import for a single site by parameter groups.

1. Double check that your server name and database numbers are correct for your data. These are displayed below the "Data import" notebook tab.

1. Type a site ID into the site number input box.
1. Select "All" parameter groups from the drop down menu for parameter code group to pull data for all parameters or select a group of parameters.
1. Leave the date range input unchanged to pull the entire period of record or enter a date range in the date range input to pull a subset of the data.
1. Click the "Import Data" button to import the data.
1. Some dialog boxes will open describing what is happening as the program pulls data and generates tables. If one of these boxes remains open for an extended period of time (> 1 minute for most datasets), then an error has occurred. Check your inputs and verify that your database and server number are correct and that your ODBC connection is working with R. 

If you encounter issues with the data import, send an email to tmills@usgs.gov and/or post an issue on the WQReview GitHub page at [WQReview Issues](https://github.com/USGS-R/WQReview/issues)

We can now begin to work with the data.

#Importing data for multiple sites and custom parameter codes using a "favorites" list
In addition to pulling data for a single site by parameter group, we can also pull in data for multiple sites using a list of parameters that we are interested in. 

1. Create a list of sites and save it as a .csv file. This is best done in MS Excel. 
1. Create a list of parameter codes and save it as a .csv file. See figure below for example files.

<img src="manual_dataimport2.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 400px;"/>

1. Close WQReview if open from previous import from above.
1. Open WQReview using the "siteids" and "pcodes" arguments in addition to your server information. The "siteids" and "pcodes" arguments are the path names to your files. For example in CO for the two files shown above we would run the WQReview() function as follows

```R
WQReview(siteids = "pathofdirectory/AllsiteIDs.csv", 
pcodes = "pathofdirectory/Boone_Creek_pcodes.csv",
dlserver.name = "NWISCO", env.db.num = "01", qa.db.num = "02")
```

**NOTE THAT THE FILENAMES ARE IN QUOTES AND THAT THE PATHS ARE CASE SENSITIVE.**

3. Now when WQReview loads, the siteIDs and pcodes will be stored in our favorites lists.
1. To access our favorites list, we will use the radio buttons under the "Site info" and "Parameter info" frames.
1. Click the radio button to the "Favorite site list" and "Favorite pcode" list options and a list of siteIDs and pcodes will appear.
1. These are just lists and none of these sites are selected for import until you click on one. You can select multiple sites and pcodes by using ctrl-click or shift-click.
1. Select your sites and pcodes and click "import data" to import the data.
1. Note: you can edit your favorites inside the GUI by clicking the "Edit favorites" button. To change a value click on the cell and type in the new value, then push the down arrow on your keyboard to store it. To add a new value click the last cell and then push the down arrow on your keyboard to create a new cell. Click "Update Table" when you are finished to update the favorites table. This will update the table in the GUI but WILL NOT save the changes to your .csv file. Thus, it is recommended that all significant changes be made directly to your .csv file using Excel or another text editor.

#Importing data for multiple sites and custom parameter codes using a .csv file inputs
The third option for importing data is to use .csv files of siteIDs and pcodes. If you do not wish to pull data for a subset of a larger favorite site list or pcode list then it makes sense to read the input directly from your .csv files. 

1. Start WQReview using the WQReview() function as above, but only the server and database arguments are required for this type of data import.
1. Click the radio button to the third options "SiteIDs from file" and "pcodes from file"
1. A dialog box will appear below the favorites list where we can manually enter the path to your .csv files, or browse to them using the "browse" buttons.
1. Once the field has been populated with the paths to our respective files, we can import the data using the "Import data" button.

###Any combination of the above methods can be used for site inputs and pcode inputs. For example, we can select sites from our favorite list but then pull parameters by parameter code group.
