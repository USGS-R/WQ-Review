#Q:I click "Get Data" in the import screen and nothing happens except I get the messages "Problem with data import, please check import criteria" and "first argument is not an open RODBC channel".
##A: 
This error indicates that your ODBC connection is not setup correctly. Follow the steps in the installation instructions for setting up the ODBC connection. Make sure that the "DSN" entry box contains the name of your NWIS ODBC connection EXACTLY as named in the ODBC administrator User DSN section. 

#Q: How do I remove an entry from an input box, like deleting a site or parameter selection?
##A: 
Simply click the specific entry you want to delete and hit "backspace" or "delete" to remove it. Alternatively, click the cursor in the input box as if adding a new entry, but hold down backspace to delete entries.

#Q: Nothing appears in my Blank, Replicate, or Filtered vs Unfiltered tables and I get an error message.
##A: 
There are no data available at your site(s) for these tables. In the case of replicates, this could be due to miscoded environmental-replicate sample pairs. Make sure both the environmental and replicate sample of the pair are coded with Sample Type = 7

#Q: I try to read in a QWDATA site file to pull data and it does not work.
##A: 
QWDATA site files will not work because the agency code is placed infront of the site number. The sitefile must be 1 column of site numbers only.

#Q: I have tons or parameters at my site, is there an easier way to select a parameter than scrolling through hundreds of parameters?
##A: 
Yes! Click in the input box for parameter code and type part of the parameter code number or the analyte name and the box will automatically filter to your search.

#Q: Can I save or print plots I generate in the GUI?
##A: 
Yes. Right-click on the plot and select "save as" or "print"

#Q: Can I plot multiple sites on the same plot?
##A: 
In most cases, yes. Select multiple sites in the station number input. By default all sites will be plotted on the same plot, with no symbology to differentiate the sites. If you would like to have separate plots, select "Facet" from the Multisite drop down menu.

#Q: Why are some symbols highlighted in red?
##A: 
Samples or results that have been flagged in the auto-check tables are highlighted in red in all plots that pertain to that particular flag. Result-level flags only highlight in plots that deal with that result. Higher-level flags, such as chargebalance, affect multiple parameters and thus show up in all plots. For example, a high calcium flag will show up highlighted in a timeseries of calcium but not magnesium, whereas a chargebalance flag will be highlighted everywhere.You can see what flags are causing highlighting by hovering over the sample with your mouse cursor.
